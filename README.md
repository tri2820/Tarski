# Tarski theorem prover
![Proof of concept](https://media.giphy.com/media/uJ5Hs8yxaSO1NcbdcJ/giphy.gif)

- Online interactive first-order logic theorem prover with Tarski axiom set for Euclidean geometry.
- Embed several aspects of predicate functor logic directly into the GUI. Expressed axiom schema as a monad.
- Leverage Elm type system to formally verify the designâ€™s correctness. Explore Zipper data structure capability as an alternative method to identify generated data instead of wrapping inside the Random monad.

# Roadmap
- Monad to geometrically graph the current state of theorems
- High level axioms / Birkhoff's axioms / First order axiomization of the reals.
